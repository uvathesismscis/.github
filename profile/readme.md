[**Viszlab**](https://wwww.viszlab.github.io) is a tangible physical data visualization for the [Lab42](https://lab42.uva.nl/) building. An interactive experience using environment sensor data to offer Human Building-Interaction. Viszlab is developed as a Thesis and Graduation project for the Master (MSc) Information Studies: [Information Systems](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/information-studies/information-studies.html) (track) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) by part-time student [Danny de Vries](https://www.dandevri.es/).

* **Master**: Master Information Studies: Information Systems (track)
* **University**: University of Amsterdam (UvA)
* **Institute**: Informatics Institute
* **Research Group**: Digital Interactions Lab
* **Student**: BSc Danny de Vries (14495643)
* **Supervisor**: PhD dr. Hamed Seiied Alavi 

#### The Research
The broad objective of this project is to analyze and visualize data on the comfort levels at LAB42 building. This includes the four classic dimensions of comfort (thermal, visual, acoustic, and airquality), but also other aspects such as visual privacy, accessibility, and so forth. Data-oriented methods will be applied to elicit the mostinfluential factors.

#### Project files
This organization hosts several repositories related to the project ranging from documentation for the project in LaTex to actual code and models for the prototype:

* **documentation**: acts as a product biography during the thesis project and includes all research performed
* **prototype**: code, 3D models and a collection of photos and videos for the physical prototype
* **thesis**: latex hosted version of the thesis paper, also downloadable as .pdf
* **milestones**: monorepo for all milestone deliverables during the thesis project for supervisors
